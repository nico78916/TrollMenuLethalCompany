# Troll Menu Mod
This mod adds a menu to troll your friends with. It is a work in progress, and I will be adding more features soon.

## Features

### Spawn Menu

The spawn menu list differents enemies to spawn Outside or Inside.

- [x] List all players in the game
- [x] Choose a player to spawn the enemy at
- [x] Spawn at a random player location
- [x] Spawn at a selected player location
- [x] Spawn at a random location
- [ ] Spawn at a selected location

### Scrap Menu

The scrap menu allows you to change value and amount of scrap the map should spawn.
You have to wait the next round to see the changes. (It's changed in the map loading).
In this menu you edit the random (min and max) value/amount of scrap. If you want a specific value/amount, you can just set the same value for max and min.

- [x] select the amount of scrap to spawn
- [x] select the value of scrap to spawn

### Player Menu

The player menu allows you to change the player's health, stamina, and speed.

### Troll Menu (WIP)

The troll menu allows you to troll your friends with different options.
- [ ] make Item in hand drop
- [ ] Toggle lights
- [ ] Close/Open doors
- [ ] Open/Close door near player
- [ ] Close/Open Big doors
- [ ] Open/Close Big door near player
- [ ] Lock /Unlock doors
- [ ] Lock/Unlock doors near player
- [ ] Unlock/lock Door you are looking at
- [ ] Open/Close Big Door you are looking at


## Known issues

- You are not notified when the mod is loaded. You can check if it is loaded by pressing F1 in game.
- The mod does not notify when you spawn an enemy or if you change the scrap value. You can check if it worked by looking at the console.

## Installation

You will need to install the [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) mod loader.
(Put the BepInEx folder in the game root folder here in `.../common/Lethal Company/`)
Then download the latest release of the mod and place it in the `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

## Usage
In game, press F1 to open the menu.
Some menus are available only when in game.

At this time, using the mod in multiplayer without being the host was not tested.
