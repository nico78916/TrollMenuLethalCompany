# Troll Menu Mod
This mod adds a menu to troll your friends with. It is a work in progress, and I will be adding more features soon.

## Features

### Spawn Menu

You can spawn enemies :
- Near a (Random) player position
- At a random location
- Spawn behind a (random) player
### Important !
	If your target is outside and want to spawn an inside enemy behind him only the following enemies will work :
	- Nutcracker
	- Crawler
	- DressGirl
	- LassoMan (does not kill the player)
### Scrap Menu

Use this menu to change the value and amount of the items on map generation.

### Alive Enemies Menu

List all the alive enemies and you can :
- Kill them (only option for now)
- Teleport to enemy (only for you)
- Damage enemy (set HP to 1 but does not make it killable)
- Heal enemy (set HP to default)- Freeze enemy (Only stop movement for now) Freezing an frozen enemy will unfreeze it.
The objective of next update is to teleport them to a random location or a player location.

## Known issues (not to fix soon)

Most of options are not working if you are not the host.
You can still spawn inside enemies behind a outside player but it will be laggy or simply inactive

## Installation

You will need to install the [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) mod loader.
(Put the BepInEx folder in the game root folder here in `.../common/Lethal Company/`)
Then download the latest release of the mod and place it in the `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

## Usage
In game, press F1 to open the menu.

At this time, the mod has not been tested while not being the host.

To open console press F2
